      <h3>What is Income Inequality?</h3>
      <p>Income inequality refers to how evenly or unevenly income is distributed in a society.  In an inequal society, a small group of people earn most of the income.</p>
      <p>In an equal society, everyone has the same income.  A uniformly rich country is just as equal as one in which everyone is poor.</p>
