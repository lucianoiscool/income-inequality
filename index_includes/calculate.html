      <h2>How We Calculate Income Inequality</h2>
      <p class="usa-font-lead">Income Inequality is calculated in several ways:</p>
    </header>
    <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <h3>The Gini Coefficient</a></h3>
    <p>This the most widely used measure when discussing income inquality.  The Gini Coefficient ranges from 0 to 1.</p>
    <p>If everyone in a group has the same income, the Gini Coefficient is 0. A coefficient of 1 indicates perfect inequality - all income goes to a single person.  The Gini Coefficient is a relative measure of income disparity, and does not take family size into account when calculating income.</p>

    <h3>Income by Quintiles</a></h3>
    <p>The Census also reports income by dividing the US population into 5 equal groups, or quintiles, based on their income.  The </p>
    <p>In a perfectly equal society, each quintile would receive 20% (or 1/5th) of the nation's income. In a perfectly inequal society (with a Gini Coefficient of 1), the top quintile would earn 100% of the nation's income.</p>

    <h3>Alternate Methods</h3>
    <p>Because the Gini Coefficient has several limitations, other statistical methods have been devised in combination or as alternatives:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/inequality/about/theil.html">The Theil Index</a> is similar to the Gini index.  It is a single statistic that summarizes
the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/inequality/about/atkinson.html">The Atkinson Measure</a> is
useful in determining which end of the income distribution contributed most to inequality.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/inequality/about/mld.html">The Mean Logarithmic Deviation</a> measures the gap
between median and average income.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/inequality/about/equiv.html">Equivalence Adjustment of Income</a> takes into consideration the number of people living in the household and how these people share resources and take advantage of economies of scale.
